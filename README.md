## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (already done with default values):
```bash
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reload
- `npm run build`: Builds the TypeScript code to JavaScript
- `npm start`: Runs the built JavaScript code in production mode
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite

## Development

The development server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.
